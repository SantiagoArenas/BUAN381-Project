### Step 1: Set Up the R Project

1. **Open RStudio**: Launch RStudio on your computer.

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click on `File` > `New Project...`.
   - Choose `New Directory`.
   - Select `New Project`.
   - Name your project (e.g., `PredictiveAnalyticsProject`).
   - Choose a location to save the project (e.g., `/Users/santi/Desktop/AnalyticsProject/`).
   - Click `Create Project`.

### Step 2: Organize Project Structure

Create the following folder structure within your project directory:

```
PredictiveAnalyticsProject/
│
├── data/
│   ├── test.csv
│
├── scripts/
│   ├── data_preprocessing.R
│   ├── regression_analysis.R
│   ├── classification_analysis.R
│
├── reports/
│   ├── regression_report.Rmd
│   ├── classification_report.Rmd
│
├── README.md
└── instructions.txt
```

### Step 3: Add Necessary Files

1. **Copy the CSV File**:
   - Move `test.csv` into the `data/` folder.

2. **Create R Scripts**:
   - In the `scripts/` folder, create the following R scripts:
     - `data_preprocessing.R`: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
     - `regression_analysis.R`: For regression modeling tasks.
     - `classification_analysis.R`: For classification modeling tasks.

3. **Create R Markdown Reports**:
   - In the `reports/` folder, create the following R Markdown files:
     - `regression_report.Rmd`: For documenting regression analysis results.
     - `classification_report.Rmd`: For documenting classification analysis results.

4. **Create a README File**:
   - In the root of your project, create a `README.md` file to describe the project, its purpose, and how to run the analysis.

5. **Add Instructions File**:
   - Copy the contents of `instructions.txt` into a file named `instructions.txt` in the root of your project.

### Step 4: Initialize Version Control (Optional)

If you want to use Git for version control:

1. **Initialize Git**:
   - In RStudio, go to `Tools` > `Version Control` > `Project Setup...`.
   - Choose `Git` and click `OK`.

2. **Commit Initial Files**:
   - Use the Git pane in RStudio to commit your initial project structure.

### Step 5: Start Coding

Now you can start coding in the respective R scripts. Here’s a brief outline of what each script might contain:

- **data_preprocessing.R**:
  ```r
  # Load necessary libraries
  library(dplyr)
  library(tidyr)

  # Load the dataset
  data <- read.csv("data/test.csv")

  # Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
  # (e.g., handling missing values, converting data types, etc.)

  # Save the cleaned data
  write.csv(data, "data/cleaned_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  ```

- **regression_analysis.R**:
  ```r
  # Load necessary libraries
  library(ggplot2)
  library(caret)

  # Load cleaned data
  data <- read.csv("data/cleaned_data.csv")

  # Perform regression analysis
  # (e.g., model fitting, evaluation, etc.)
  ```

- **classification_analysis.R**:
  ```r
  # Load necessary libraries
  library(ggplot2)
  library(caret)

  # Load cleaned data
  data <- read.csv("data/cleaned_data.csv")

  # Perform classification analysis
  # (e.g., model fitting, evaluation, etc.)
  ```

- **regression_report.Rmd** and **classification_report.Rmd**:
  - Use these files to document your analysis, results, and visualizations.

### Step 6: Document Your Work

Make sure to document your code and analysis thoroughly in the R scripts and R Markdown files. This will help you and your team understand the analysis process and results.

### Conclusion

You now have a structured R project set up for conducting the predictive analytics analysis as per the provided instructions. You can start implementing the analysis steps outlined in the instructions using the organized files and folders.
