### Step 1: Create a New R Project

1. **Open RStudio**.
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click on `File` > `New Project...`.
   - Choose `New Directory`.
   - Select `New Project`.
   - Name your project (e.g., `PredictiveAnalyticsProject`).
   - Choose a location on your computer (e.g., `/Users/santi/Desktop/AnalyticsProject/`).
   - Click `Create Project`.

### Step 2: Set Up Project Structure

Inside your new project directory, create the following folders and files:

1. **Folders**:
   - `data/`: For storing datasets (e.g., `test.csv`).
   - `scripts/`: For R scripts.
   - `results/`: For storing output results (e.g., plots, tables).
   - `reports/`: For any reports or markdown files.
   - `figures/`: For storing figures and plots.

2. **Files**:
   - `README.md`: A brief description of the project.
   - `data/test.csv`: Place the provided `test.csv` file here.
   - `scripts/analysis.R`: An R script for conducting the analysis.
   - `scripts/cleaning.R`: An R script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - `scripts/modeling.R`: An R script for modeling tasks (regression and classification).
   - `scripts/visualization.R`: An R script for visualizing results.
   - `reports/project_report.Rmd`: An R Markdown file for compiling results and findings.

### Step 3: Populate the Files

1. **README.md**:
   ```markdown
   # Predictive Analytics Project

   This project aims to demonstrate the ability to work through the analytics pipeline from beginning to end, focusing on predictive modeling using regression and classification techniques.

   ## Project Structure
   - `data/`: Contains datasets.
   - `scripts/`: Contains R scripts for analysis.
   - `results/`: Contains output results.
   - `reports/`: Contains reports and markdown files.
   - `figures/`: Contains figures and plots.
   ```

2. **scripts/analysis.R**:
   ```r
   # Load necessary libraries
   library(tidyverse)
   library(caret)

   # Load the dataset
   data <- read.csv("data/test.csv")

   # Display the first few rows of the dataset
   head(data)
   ```

3. **scripts/cleaning.R**:
   ```r
   # Load necessary libraries
   library(dplyr)

   # Data cleaning function
   clean_data <- function(data) {
       # Example cleaning steps
       data <- data %>%
           filter(!is.na(lat) & !is.na(longitude)) %>%
           mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)  # Convert character columns to factors
       return(data)
   }

   # Load and clean the dataset
   data <- read.csv("data/test.csv")
   cleaned_data <- clean_data(data)
   ```

4. **scripts/modeling.R**:
   ```r
   # Load necessary libraries
   library(caret)

   # Load cleaned data
   cleaned_data <- read.csv("data/cleaned_data.csv")

   # Example regression model
   set.seed(123)
   train_index <- createDataPartition(cleaned_data$latestPrice, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
   train_data <- cleaned_data[train_index, ]
   test_data <- cleaned_data[-train_index, ]

   # Fit a linear model
   model <- lm(latestPrice ~ propertyTaxRate + garageSpaces + hasCooling, data = train_data)
   summary(model)

   # Predictions
   predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)
   ```

5. **scripts/visualization.R**:
   ```r
   # Load necessary libraries
   library(ggplot2)

   # Example visualization
   ggplot(data = cleaned_data, aes(x = propertyTaxRate, y = latestPrice)) +
       geom_point() +
       geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
       labs(title = "Property Tax Rate vs Latest Price",
            x = "Property Tax Rate",
            y = "Latest Price")
   ```

6. **reports/project_report.Rmd**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Predictive Analytics Project Report"
   author: "Your Name"
   date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
   output: html_document
   ---

   ## Introduction

   This report summarizes the findings from the predictive analytics project.

   ## Data Cleaning

   ```{r}
   source("scripts/cleaning.R")
   ```

   ## Modeling

   ```{r}
   source("scripts/modeling.R")
   ```

   ## Visualization

   ```{r}
   source("scripts/visualization.R")
   ```

   ## Conclusion

   Summarize your findings and insights here.
   ```

### Step 4: Save and Commit to Version Control

If you are using Git for version control, initialize a Git repository in your project folder:

1. Open the terminal in RStudio.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up project structure and files"
   ```

### Step 5: Run Your Analysis

You can now run your analysis by executing the scripts in the correct order, starting with data cleaning, followed by modeling, and finally visualization. You can also knit the R Markdown report to generate a comprehensive report of your findings.

### Conclusion

You have successfully set up an R project with all necessary files for conducting the analysis as described in the provided instructions. You can now proceed with your analysis and modeling tasks.
